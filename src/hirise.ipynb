    "The Mars HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) [[1]](#1) is a camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which has been orbiting and studying Mars since 2006. A product of this payload's years of service has been the curation of the Mars orbital image (HiRISE) labeled data set [[2]](#2) by NASA. This dataset provides approximately 73,031 labelled images of the Martian terrain from an orbital perspective. **Figure 1** shows one of the first images taken with the HiRISE camera."

    "Artificial intelligence, in varying forms, has been a cornerstone of robotic space exploration. In the early days of robotic space exploration, we deployed autonomous rovers and spacecraft that needed to be self-reliant as they navigated uncharted territory. As powerful as our little explorers were, they lacked advanced computing capabilities and still relied on ground-in-the-loop for key decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future missions are poised to take greater risk and explore more challenging environments. Because of this, we **need** advanced autonomy. Machine learning has made huge strides in recent times, breaking records and discovering novel things. Because of this rennaissance, the space community, and spacecraft software engineers like me, are very enthusiastic about the possibilities of running deep learning models on future spacecraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however...some challenges...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The black box nature of deep learning models makes it difficult to understand why the model predicts what it predicts. For flight software engineers like me, non-determinism is unsettling to say the least.\n",
    "2. Deep learning models require **lots** of high-quality data. This is a challenge because space data is either non-existent, very limited, or very bad.\n",
    "3. Deep learning requires a lot of compute resources. The most advanced computing platform we've but in space as of 2024 is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter [[3]](#3). This means we need to be really considerate of our model architecture choice."

    "The foundational paper this project will be compared to is _Deep Mars: CNN Classification of Mars Imagery for the PDS Imaging Atlas_ by Wagstaff et. al. [[4]](#4). In the paper, the authors set out to train a convolutional neural network to allow scientists to conduct more granular searches on images in NASA's planetary imagery database.\n",
    "The authors successfully trained an AlexNet model to achieve 99.1%, 88.1%, and 90.6% accuracy across their training, validation, and test sets respectively. A key contributor to their success was taking a pre-trained AleNet model and fine-tuning it to the HiRISE dataset."
